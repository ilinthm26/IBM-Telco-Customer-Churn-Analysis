📊 Customer Churn Analysis & Retention Strategy
📌 Project Overview

Customer churn significantly impacts recurring revenue businesses. This project analyzes customer behavior to identify churn drivers, quantify revenue at risk, and recommend actionable retention strategies.

The objective is not only to analyze churn patterns but to translate insights into measurable business impact.

🎯 Business Objectives

Reduce overall customer churn rate

Identify high-risk customer segments

Quantify revenue at risk

Recommend data-driven retention strategies

📂 Dataset

Telco Customer Churn Dataset

Includes:

Customer demographics

Contract type

Tenure

Monthly & total charges

Service subscriptions

Churn label

🔎 Key Business Questions

Which customers are most likely to churn?

What service attributes influence churn?

Does pricing impact churn probability?

How does contract type affect retention?

What is the revenue impact of churn?

🧹 Data Preparation

Checked missing values and data types

Converted categorical variables

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
🔹 Churn Rate KPI

Overall churn rate calculated

Segment-wise churn comparison performed

🔹 Contract Type Impact

Month-to-Month customers show highest churn rate

Long-term contracts significantly reduce churn probability

🔹 Tenure Analysis

Customers with tenure < 12 months show highest churn risk

Churn probability decreases as tenure increases

🔹 Pricing Impact

Higher monthly charges moderately increase churn likelihood

🔹 Geographic Analysis

No significant churn variation across regions

💰 Revenue Impact Analysis
Current Revenue at Risk

Calculated total revenue generated by churned customers.

High-Risk Segment Simulation

Simulated a 10% churn reduction in Month-to-Month customers.

Result:
A 10% retention improvement in high-risk segments can recover significant annual revenue.
